# Optimality of Huffman Trees

This file contains the main theorem proving the optimality of Huffman trees.

Huffman’s algorithm constructs a tree that minimizes the total cost
for a given set of symbol frequencies.

## Main Result

Theorem `optimum_huffman` : Shows that the Huffman tree built from any non-empty forest is optimal,
  no other tree with the same alphabet and frequencies has lower cost.

/--
The Huffman tree constructed from a forest `ts` using the `huffman` function
is optimal.
